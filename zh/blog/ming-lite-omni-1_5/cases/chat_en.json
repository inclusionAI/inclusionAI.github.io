Understand the meaning of Δct:**   Δct is the difference in relative expression between the target gene (cGAS-qF+qR or EGFP-cGAS) and the reference gene (cTubulin). A smaller Δct indicates a smaller difference in expression between the target and reference genes. <br> **2. Compare Δct under different primers:** <br> - **cGAS-qF+qR primer:**   - Wild type: Δct = 8.06   - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -0.15   - Difference: 8.06 - (-0.15) = 8.21 <br> - **EGFP-cGAS monoclonal primer:**   - Wild type: Δct = 10.44   - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -2.9   - Difference: 10.44 - (-2.9) = 13.34 <br> - **EGFP-cGAS-qF+qR primer:**   - Wild type: Δct = 21.43   - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -13.45   - Difference: 21.43 - (-13.45) = 34.88 <br> **3. Conclusion:**   Under the **EGFP-cGAS monoclonal** primer, the difference in Δct between samples is the smallest (Δct difference is 13.34), indicating the smallest difference in expression between samples under this primer. <br>  <br>  **Summary:**   The difference in Δct between samples is smallest under the **EGFP-cGAS monoclonal** primer.
