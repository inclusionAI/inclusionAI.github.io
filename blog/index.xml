      <description>📖 Technical Report | 🤗 Hugging Face｜ 🤖 ModelScope
Introduction We introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals.</description>

Introduction Ming-lite-omni, a light version of Ming-omni, which is derived from Ling-lite and features 2.8 billion activated parameter. Ming-lite-omni is a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-lite-omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers.</description>

Introduction Ling is a MoE LLM provided and open-sourced by InclusionAI. We introduce two different sizes, which are Ling-lite and Ling-plus. Ling-lite has 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-plus has 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models demonstrate impressive performance compared to existing models in the industry.
Their structure makes it easy to scale up and down and adapt to different tasks, so users can use these models for a wide range of tasks, from processing natural language to solving complex problems.</description>

      <description>Introduction Agent exhibits powerful capabilities by interacting with the external environment and making decisions based on the feedback it receives from the environment. For complex problems, it is often necessary for an agent to have multi-turn interactions with the environment to reach a solution. The complexity and dynamism of environments, coupled with the necessity for multi-turn interactions, pose numerous challenges in training agents.
We introduce AgenticLearning, an open-source agent training paradigm designed to empower researchers to train and evaluate autonomous agents effectively.</description>
