Generation = the right hand: coherent pixels, style, aesthetics. But training a model to recognize 10,000 cat photos doesn’t magically make it capable of painting cats, and painting cats repeatedly doesn’t make it understand cats better.\nWorse, in multitask training, the two often compete for resources — optimizations for understanding can hurt generation, and vice versa.\nWe’re missing a catalyst: a task that forces the left and right hands to evolve together.\nThe Struggle: 16% Segmentation and Out-of-Control Generation Before finding our solution, our unified model was struggling with generative segmentation:\nGiven an instruction like “segment the banana in the upper-right corner”, we wanted the model to output a segmentation mask directly.\nThe results were painful.\nOn RefCOCO-val, our cIoU plateaued at ~16%.\nThe root cause is the distribution gap.\nGenerative models thrive on natural, continuous image distributions. Segmentation masks, however, are synthetic, abstract, binary maps — as unnatural as it gets for an image generator.\nIt was like asking a painter to draw an X-ray: doable, but far from their artistic instincts.\nHere, generation wasn’t helping segmentation — it was tripping it up.\nWe needed a new task that:\nMet the precision demands of understanding. Played to the strengths of generation. The “Aha” Moment: Dressing Segmentation in Color Here’s the analogy that unlocked it for us:\nIf you want a child to mark an object, is it easier to have them draw a tight outline with a pencil, or fill it in with bright colors?\nObviously, the latter.\nInstead of forcing our model to output abstract black-and-white masks, we turned the segmentation task into a color-editing task.\nExample:\nInstruction: “segment the banana in the upper-right” Old way: Output a mask ❌ New way: Directly edit the image: “paint the banana purple”, “make the banana red”, etc. ✅ This brought the task’s data distribution back to the realm of natural images — where generative models shine.\nWhy This Works: The Hidden Catalyst That small twist turned out to be exactly the catalyst we’d been searching for.\nBoosting Understanding: To color the banana without bleeding outside the boundary, the model must internally nail pixel-perfect segmentation. The segmentation step became an implicit prerequisite to editing.\nUnleashing Generation: No more awkward synthetic masks — the model is doing what it knows best: image-to-image editing. All its strengths in shading, texture, and edge blending go into making the change look natural.\nFor the first time, the left hand and right hand weren’t fighting — they were helping each other.\nThe Numbers: From 16% to 72.4% — and Beyond 1. SOTA-level Segmentation The cIoU score didn’t just improve — it soared from 16% to 72.4% on RefCOCO-val, a relative gain of over 350%.\nQualitatively, the model outperformed competitors in pinpointing and segmenting targets, even in reasoning-heavy cases.\nAgainst Qwen-Image and Nano Banana, our model:\nLocated small or occluded targets more reliably. Produced boundaries that were visually and semantically aligned with instructions. Our model (right) accurately locates and segments the target subject. Qwen-Image (second from left) fails to locate the correct target, while Nano-banana (third from left) fails to accurately segment the man’s head and has loose boundary lines.\nFor the prompt “please segment the girl with red mask,” our model (right) is precise. Qwen-Image (second from left) misses the feet, and Nano-banana (third from left) alters the subject’s proportions.\nDuring evaluation, thanks to the high consistency of non-edited regions in our model, we can directly derive the segmentation mask by calculating the difference between the edited result and the original image.\nThe results show that our model’s performance on segmentation is now on par with specialized vision models.\nModel Category Model Name RefCOCO (val) RefCOCO+ (val) RefCOCOg (val) Vision Specialist Models VLT 67.5 56.3 55.0 CRIS 70.5 62.3 59.9 LAVT 72.7 62.1 61.2 PolyFormer-B 74.8 67.6 67.8 MLLM + Specialist (SAM) LISA-7B 74.1 62.4 66.4 PixelLM-7B 73.0 66.3 69.3 Generative Models Nano-banana* 15.7 13.9 14.9 Qwen-Image-Edit* 30.3 28.8 34.0 Ming-Lite-Omni1.5 72.4 62.8 64.3 For each test set, Nano-banana and Qwen-Image-Edit was evaluated on a randomly sampled subset of 500 images, to reduce computational cost while preserving the key statistical trends. We observed that Nano-banana frequently fails to accurately grasp the image segmentation intent during inference, leading to its comparatively lower evaluation metrics. This may be attributed to differences in training objectives and data emphasis.\n2. Sharper, More Controllable Editing The beauty of this method is that it not only fixed the segmentation weakness but also dramatically enhanced the model’s general editing capabilities.\nBecause the model has learned an unprecedented “respect for boundaries” through thousands of “precise coloring” exercises, this “muscle memory” for fine-grained control has transferred to all editing tasks. Our edit controllability score saw a significant jump from 7.69 to 8.12 across sub-tasks like background, color, and material changes.\nPrompt: “remove the bow tie of the man on the far right.” Our model (right) precisely removes only the target bow tie while maintaining background consistency. Qwen (second from left) incorrectly removes multiple bow ties and introduces inconsistencies. Nano-banana (third from left) also struggles with consistency.\n3. Stronger ID Consistency A core challenge in portrait editing is maintaining identity. Our model excels here as well. Whether changing a hairstyle or adjusting an expression, the model skillfully preserves the person’s core features.\nTop Row (Turn head): Our model (right) maintains ID and background consistency, unlike competitors. Middle Row (Smile): Our model (right) correctly follows the prompt while preserving ID, avoiding distortions seen in others. Bottom Row (Change background): Our model (right) excels at preserving the subject’s ID and appearance during a background swap.\nSee More Editing Consistency in Action: An Honest Look: Where We Can Still Improve Despite the leap forward, challenges remain:\nLarge pose changes (e.g., standing → running) need more reliability. Multi-step or compound instructions require better parsing and execution. Instruction diversity support needs expansion. These are our next milestones.\nTakeaway: The Next Catalysts Are Out There From 16% to 72.4% — this wasn’t driven by a massive architecture overhaul or billion-image datasets.\nIt came from one change in task design.\nThe lesson: Instead of gluing capabilities together after the fact, find naturally cooperative tasks — where solving the problem requires multiple abilities to mesh seamlessly.\n“Segmentation-as-editing” is just the first example.\nWe suspect 3D understanding, video generation, and other domains have their own hidden catalysts, waiting to be discovered.\nAt last, AI’s left and right hands have learned to high-five.\nAnd this is only the overture.\nTry out our open-source model Ming-lite-omni 1.5 on our GitHub Page / Demo Page.

Our edit controllability score saw a significant jump from <strong>7.69 to 8.12</strong> across sub-tasks like background, color, and material changes.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_wp0xz6/afts/img/A*szjcQqQkC80AAAAAgIAAAAgAevzJAQ/original alt="Editing Controllability Comparison">
<em>Prompt: &ldquo;remove the bow tie of the man on the far right.&rdquo; Our model (right) precisely removes only the target bow tie while maintaining background consistency. Qwen (second from left) incorrectly removes multiple bow ties and introduces inconsistencies. Nano-banana (third from left) also struggles with consistency.</em></p><h4 id=3-stronger-id-consistency>3. Stronger ID Consistency<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-stronger-id-consistency>#</a></h4><p>A core challenge in portrait editing is maintaining identity. Our model excels here as well. Whether changing a hairstyle or adjusting an expression, the model skillfully preserves the person&rsquo;s core features.</p><p><img loading=lazy src=https://mdn.alipayobjects.com/huamei_wp0xz6/afts/img/A*Tc2-RoAHys8AAAAAd9AAAAgAevzJAQ/original alt="ID Consistency Comparison">
<em>Top Row (Turn head): Our model (right) maintains ID and background consistency, unlike competitors. Middle Row (Smile): Our model (right) correctly follows the prompt while preserving ID, avoiding distortions seen in others. Bottom Row (Change background): Our model (right) excels at preserving the subject&rsquo;s ID and appearance during a background swap.</em></p><p><strong>See More Editing Consistency in Action:</strong>
