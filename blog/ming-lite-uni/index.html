Introduction
Ming-Lite-Uni is an open-source multimodal framework that includes a newly developed unified visual generator, and a native multimodal autoregressive model meant to integrate vision and language.
This project offers an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while offering the innovative multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. Ming-Lite-Uni utilizes a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, allowing native multimodal AR models to execute text-to-image production and instruction-based image editing tasks, hence enhancing their functionalities beyond mere visual comprehension. Our experimental findings demonstrate the robust efficacy of Ming-Lite-Uni and highlight the remarkable fluidity of its interactive process. Ming-Lite-Uni is now in the alpha phase and will soon undergo additional refinement."><meta name=author content="inclusionAI, Ant Group"><link rel=canonical href=https://inclusionai.github.io/blog/ming-lite-uni/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fa92d8da4b04eca0dd3a888f432d2e4fabc3dec8bebb65e348f9ce26d866c08e.css integrity="sha256-+pLY2ksE7KDdOoiPQy0uT6vD3si+u2XjSPnOJthmwI4=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://inclusionai.github.io/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://inclusionai.github.io/favicon.png><link rel=manifest href=https://inclusionai.github.io/site.webmanifest><meta name=theme-color content="#615CED"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://inclusionai.github.io/blog/ming-lite-uni/><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=https://inclusionai.github.io/zh/blog/ming-lite-uni/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/js/custom.e9080c0a180dc80cf80d5fef7c857effb14f65c998e22134feb9896034b1b81a.js integrity="sha256-6QgMChgNyAz4DV/vfIV+/7FPZcmY4iE0/rmJYDSxuBo="></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-Juol1FqnotbkyZUT5Z7gUPjQ9gzlwCENvUZTpQBAPxtusdwFLRy382PSDx5UUJ4/ crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-97gW6UIJxnlKemYavrqDHSX3SiygeOwIZhwyOKRfSaf0JWKRVj9hLASHgFTzT+0O crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+VBxd3r6XgURycqtZ117nYw44OOcIax56Z4dCRWbxyPt0Koah1uHoK0o4+/RRE05 crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}],throwOnError:!1})})</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-NMEMBZ8R90"></script><script>var doNotTrack=!1,dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes";if(!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-NMEMBZ8R90")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="Ming-Lite-Uni: Advancements in Unified Architecture for Natural Multimodal Interaction"><meta property="og:description" content="

We sincerely value your patience as we progressively enhance our solutions and model efficacy. We are now achieving significant progress and observing favorable outcomes, with forthcoming updates anticipated—remain attentive!\n📌 Updates [2025.05.03] 🔥 Our Technical Report is in public on arxiv. [2025.05.03] 🔥 We release the fisrt version of Ming-Lite-Uni. Why It Matters Ming-Lite-Uni’s unified architecture overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional approaches:\nConventional Methods Ming-Lite-Uni’s Advantages Modular Pipelines\n(CLIP/SigLIP + Diffusion Models) End-to-End Unified Model\nSeamless understanding-generation integration Discrete Token AR\n(Limited visual grounding) Continuous Token Space\nNative support for fine-grained visual concepts Fixed-Resolution Processing\n(Artifacts in upscaling) Multi-Scale Adaptation\nConsistent quality across resolutions Separate Editing Workflows\n(Manual alignment required) Dialog-Driven Control\nNatural language guided pixel-level editing Understanding Bottlenecks\n(Visual-semantic mismatch) Joint Representation Learning\nMutually enhanced comprehension and generation Key Enhancements Unified Visual Understanding \u0026 Generation Architecture. Ming-Lite-Uni achieves an average understanding score of 69.7 on the OpenCompass leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-VL2 (66.4). At the same time, it achieves an image generation score of 0.62 on the GenEval benchmark, outperforming SDXL (0.55). Multi-Scale Learnable Tokens. We employ a novel mechanism to establish feature correlations across resolutions of 4×/8×/16×. By introducing hierarchical tokens, the model captures global layout (low-res), object structures (mid-res), and fine textures (high-res), improving GenEval by 3.5%. Multi-Scale Representation Alignment. We introduce a novel scale wised consistency loss to enforce alignment between hierarchical representations and final outputs through native-resolution optimization. This strategy directly enhances the high-res reconstruction quality (\u003e2dB PSNR) and boosts GenEval by 1.5%. AGI-Capable System. Our model supports complex chained operations, such as “generate castle → add sunset → adjust perspective”, with a swift response time of under 1 second (benchmarked with RTX 4090). The system is designed to handle instruction-driven generation-editing and is synchronized with ChatGPT-4o(aligned with the industry milestone of March 2025). Empowering Multimodal Interaction with Ming-Lite-Uni Ming-Lite-Uni acts as a unified model for multimodal understanding, extending beyond traditional NLP tasks and multimodal comprehension to enable interactive multimodal generation. This includes capabilities such as image generation, image editing, and style transfer.\nModel Structure Ming-Lite-Uni is a unified multimodal model designed for both image understanding and high-fidelity image generation. It achieves this by compressing image representations into continuous visual tokens, which are processed alongside discrete text tokens using a scaled auto-regressive Transformer. The generation capability is powered by an externally trained diffusion model (SANA), conditioned on tokens produced by the Transformer.\nBenchmark Evaluations We conduct separate quantitative evaluations of Ming-Lite-Uni on multimodal understanding and text-to-image generation using public benchmarks. For multimodal understanding, we compare against traditional models that take images and text as input and output text, as well as against recent models with visual generative capabilities. For multimodal generation, we evaluate text-to-image performance on GenEval. Please refer to our TechReport for details.\nMultimodal Understanding\nType Model Avg.
