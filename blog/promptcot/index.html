Mar 7, 2025: PromptCoT project launched, including the problem generation model, distilled models (PromptCoT-DS series), and associated datasets. Overview This repository unifies two synergistic projects aimed at advancing the frontiers of mathematical and code reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs): PromptCoT and PromptCoT-Mamba.\nPromptCoT (Synthesizing Olympiad-Level Problems for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models) addresses the critical challenge of acquiring high-quality, complex problems for training advanced LLMs. It introduces a novel methodology to systematically generate Olympiad-level mathematical problems by modeling the rationale behind expert problem design. This approach not only enhances problem diversity and difficulty but also ensures logical consistency in problem construction, providing a scalable solution for creating robust training datasets.\nPromptCoT-Mamba (Scaling Reasoning without Attention) leverages the problem generation capabilities of the PromptCoT pipeline to train PromptCoT-Mamba-7B, the first attention-free foundation model based on the Mamba-2 architecture. This model demonstrates that structured training curricula can enable attention-free models to surpass strong Transformer baselines on a wide array of competition-level math and code reasoning tasks, all while maintaining constant-memory inference without KV caching.\nTogether, these projects offer a powerful suite of tools, models, and datasets for researchers and developers working on the cutting edge of AI reasoning.\nHighlights \u0026 Key Results 1. PromptCoT: Problem Generation \u0026 Distilled Models ✨ The Missing Piece for Test-Time Scaling: A lightweight yet powerful problem generation model enabling the construction of prompt sets at any scale with sufficient quality, perfect for SFT or RL post-training. 📖 A Fully Open Project: All models (generation, distilled LLMs) and datasets (generation inputs, SFT data) are open-sourced. 🏆 Superior Performance of Distilled Models: PromptCoT-DS-7B consistently surpasses its base model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, with significant gains: +0.9% on MATH-500 (93.7%) +3.2% on AIME2024 (58.7%) +9.2% on AIME2025 (49.2%) PromptCoT-DS-7B (7B parameters) achieves results comparable to larger 32B models like S1-32B and LIMO-32B. PromptCoT-QwQ-32B sets a new standard, outperforming other 32B models by a significant margin: MATH-500: 96.7% ± 0.5% AIME2024: 83.8% ± 2.8% AIME2025: 75.4% ± 4.7% PromptCoT-DS-1.5B demonstrates competitive performance against RL-based models purely through distillation. ⚡ Efficiency Without Compromise: PromptCoT-DS-1.5B achieves 40+% AIME scores using over 15× fewer A100 GPU hours compared to models like DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview. 2. PromptCoT-Mamba: Attention-Free Reasoning 🚀 First Attention-Free SOTA: PromptCoT-Mamba-7B is the first attention-free model (Mamba-2 architecture) to outperform strong Transformer baselines in math and code reasoning. 🧠 Trained with PromptCoT Pipeline: Utilizes a structured, two-stage curriculum with data generated by PromptCoT. 💪 Strong General Performance: PromptCoT-Mamba-7B consistently outperforms 7B-scale Transformer and hybrid Mamba-Transformer baselines. MATH-500: 84.6% AIME 2024: 35.2% AIME 2025: 24.6% Livecodebench: 29.9% 🎯 Math Specialization: The math-specialized variant, PromptCoT-Mamba-Math-7B, further boosts math performance: MATH-500: 88.0% AIME 2024: 42.9% (+7.7% over generalist) AIME 2025: 30.8% (+6.2% over generalist) ⚡ Inference Efficiency: Offers substantial speedups (e.g., 3.66× faster on 24GB GPU for long sequences) and constant-memory inference, ideal for cost-sensitive or long-context workloads.
