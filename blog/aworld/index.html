The framework supports a wide range of applications, including but not limited to product prototype verification, foundation model training and Multi-Agent System (MAS) design meta-learning.\nRuntime Key Features 1. Agent Construction 2. Topology Orchestration 3. Environments • ✅ Support for various model services • ✅ Integration with MCP tools • ✅ Custom tool support • ✅ Protocol encapsulation between models and tools • ✅ Protocol encapsulation among agents • ✅ Runtime state management • ✅ State tracing support • ✅ Distributed, high-concurrency environments for training Self-Improvement with Diverse Runtimes By constructing diverse runtime environments (with tools, agents, or models in them), AWorld aims to find the limitations of a model and push intelligence forward. Here we will record some of our work to prove the effectiveness of our proposal.\nCategory Runtime Performance Key Information Tool Use Function call runtime to be released Competitive on BFCL benchmark Deep Search Search runtime to be released SOTA on HotpotQA benchmark Demo of GAIA Agent-Runtime Here we first introduce the GAIA runtime, which can be constructed on your local computer. It can be used for:\nProduct prototype verification Self-improvement training (See training pipeline for details) Follow the instructions in ./examples/gaia/README.md to initialize the GAIA agent runtime and run the demo shown above.\nWant to build your own multi-agent system? Check out the detailed tutorials below to get started! ⬇️⬇️⬇️\nInstallation Python\u003e=3.11:\ngit clone https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld cd AWorld python setup.py install Quick Start Here’s a quick start guide to: (1) create your first agent; (2) equip it with a MCP tool; (3) assign a teammate; and (4) answer a user query through teamwork.\nfrom aworld.config.conf import AgentConfig from aworld.agents.llm_agent import Agent from aworld.runner import Runners from aworld.core.agent.swarm import Swarm if __name__ == '__main__': agent_config = AgentConfig( llm_provider=\"openai\", llm_model_name=\"gpt-4o\", # Set via environment variable or direct configuration # llm_api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\", # llm_base_url=\"https://api.openai.com/v1\" ) # Register the MCP tool here, or create a separate configuration file. mcp_config = { \"mcpServers\": { \"amap-amap-sse\": { \"type\": \"sse\", \"url\": \"https://mcp.amap.com/sse?key=YOUR_API_KEY\", \"timeout\": 5, \"sse_read_timeout\": 300 } } } # Create your first agent equipped with an MCP tool search = Agent( conf=agent_config, name=\"search_agent\", system_prompt=\"You are a helpful agent.\", mcp_servers=[\"amap-amap-sse\"], # MCP server name for agent to use mcp_config=mcp_config ) # Add a new teammate to the agent summary = Agent( conf=agent_config, name=\"summary_agent\", system_prompt=\"You are a helpful summary agent.\" ) # Collaborate as a team; the default is a static workflow swarm = Swarm(search, summary) # Run agent team res = Runners.sync_run(input=\"Hotels within 1 kilometer of West Lake in Hangzhou\", swarm=swarm) print(res) Architecture AWorld is designed to achieve two primary objectives: (1) provide an efficient forward process, and (2) facilitate diverse backward processes, including but not limited to foundation model training and system design meta-learning.\nForward An illustration of the runtime, showing the message workflow when Agent1 receives a query from a user.\nBackward During training, an action-state rollout demonstration using AWorld’s distributed environments.\nDemo Running Pre-defined Agents (e.g., see demo code). Below are demonstration videos showcasing AWorld’s capabilities across various agent configurations and environments.\nMode Type Demo Single Agent Browser use ▶️ Watch Browser Demo on YouTube\nPhone use ▶️ Watch Mobile Demo on YouTube\nMulti Agent Cooperative Teams ▶️ Watch Travel Demo on YouTube\nCompetitive Teams ▶️ Watch Debate Arena on YouTube\nMixed of both Teams Coming Soon 🚀 Contributing We warmly welcome developers to join us in building and improving AWorld!
