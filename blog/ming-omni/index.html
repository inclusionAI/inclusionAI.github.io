Introduction
Ming-lite-omni, a light version of Ming-omni, which is derived from Ling-lite and features 2.8 billion activated parameter. Ming-lite-omni is a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-lite-omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-lite-omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-lite-omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, Ming-lite-omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community."><meta name=author content="inclusionAI, Ant Group"><link rel=canonical href=https://inclusionai.github.io/blog/ming-omni/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.419cab9a4e041985806269ccd5fb7e29179062491b1e90454454dcf1af0c9022.css integrity="sha256-QZyrmk4EGYWAYmnM1ft+KReQYkkbHpBFRFTc8a8MkCI=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://inclusionai.github.io/favicon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://inclusionai.github.io/favicon.png><link rel=manifest href=https://inclusionai.github.io/site.webmanifest><meta name=theme-color content="#615CED"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://inclusionai.github.io/blog/ming-omni/><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh href=https://inclusionai.github.io/zh/blog/ming-omni/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/js/custom.e9080c0a180dc80cf80d5fef7c857effb14f65c998e22134feb9896034b1b81a.js integrity="sha256-6QgMChgNyAz4DV/vfIV+/7FPZcmY4iE0/rmJYDSxuBo="></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-Juol1FqnotbkyZUT5Z7gUPjQ9gzlwCENvUZTpQBAPxtusdwFLRy382PSDx5UUJ4/ crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-97gW6UIJxnlKemYavrqDHSX3SiygeOwIZhwyOKRfSaf0JWKRVj9hLASHgFTzT+0O crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.3/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+VBxd3r6XgURycqtZ117nYw44OOcIax56Z4dCRWbxyPt0Koah1uHoK0o4+/RRE05 crossorigin=anonymous></script><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}],throwOnError:!1})})</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-NMEMBZ8R90"></script><script>var doNotTrack=!1,dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes";if(!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-NMEMBZ8R90")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="Ming-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Model for Perception and Generation"><meta property="og:description" content="
