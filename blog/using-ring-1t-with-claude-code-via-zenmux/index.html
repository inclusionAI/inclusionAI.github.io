ZenMux is an enterprise-grade AI model aggregation platform that provides unified access to leading language models worldwide. Key features include:\nUnified API: Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, and more through a single interface Intelligent Routing: Automatically select optimal models based on your needs High Availability: Built-in failover mechanisms ensure reliability Quality Assurance: AI model insurance services (coming soon) to address concerns about hallucinations and output instability With ZenMux, developers can seamlessly integrate multiple AI models without managing different APIs or endpoints.\nWhat is Claude Code? Claude Code is Anthropic’s official AI coding agent that helps you write, debug, and understand code directly from your terminal or VSCode. It combines:\nNatural conversation: Interact with AI using natural language Code awareness: Understands your project structure and context Direct execution: Reads files, makes edits, and runs commands Flexibility: Works as both a CLI tool and VSCode extension Claude Code is designed to be your AI pair programmer, handling everything from simple code questions to complex multi-file refactoring.\nWhy Ring 1T with Claude Code via ZenMux? Combining these three tools gives you:\nRing 1T’s advanced reasoning for complex coding challenges Claude Code’s intuitive interface for seamless interaction ZenMux’s unified platform for easy model access and management This guide walks you through configuring Claude Code to use Ring 1T through ZenMux—it takes just a few environment variables. The key setting is: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=\"https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic\"\nGetting Started: Installation \u0026 Configuration Step 1: Install Claude Code Important Update: npm/pnpm Installation Is Deprecated\nThe npm/pnpm installation method for Claude Code has been deprecated. If you previously installed via npm/pnpm, first uninstall the old version:\nnpm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code # or pnpm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code Then use the new native installation method.\nRecommended: Native Installation\nmacOS/Linux/WSL:\ncurl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash Windows PowerShell:\nirm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex Windows CMD:\ncurl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd \u0026\u0026 install.cmd \u0026\u0026 del install.cmd Package Managers (manual updates required):\nHomebrew (macOS):\nbrew install --cask claude-code WinGet (Windows):\nwinget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode Installation Notes\nNative installers auto-update automatically Package manager installs require manual updates via brew upgrade claude-code or winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode After installation, verify with: claude doctor For full details, see Claude Code installation docs Configure Claude Code How the Configuration Works By default, Claude Code connects to Anthropic’s service. To use Ring 1T, we redirect requests to ZenMux using environment variables. This approach:\nRequires no changes to Claude Code: Just set environment variables Uses your ZenMux API Key: Simple authentication Enables Ring 1T access: Use the powerful reasoning model in Claude Code The setup involves two key environment variables: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (ZenMux endpoint) and ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (your ZenMux API Key). This routes all Claude Code requests through ZenMux to Ring 1T.\nImportant Change in v2.0.7x\nDue to updates in Claude Code v2.0.7x, its environment-variable loading logic has changed: the env config in ~/.claude/settings.json cannot be reliably read in the following scenarios:\nWhen logging in for the first time in Claude Code When logging in again after running logout Therefore, when connecting to ZenMux, it’s recommended to standardize on shell profile environment variables to ensure both login and requests go through ZenMux’s Anthropic-compatible endpoint.\nStep 2: Get a ZenMux API Key Before configuring Claude Code, obtain a ZenMux API Key. ZenMux offers two billing options:\nBest for: Personal development, learning/exploration, Vibe Coding Features: Fixed monthly fee, predictable cost, 5–10x price advantage API Key format: `sk-ss-v1-xxx` Getting started: 1. Visit the [subscription management page](https://zenmux.ai/platform/subscription) 2. Choose a plan (Pro $20/mo, Max $100/mo, Ultra $200/mo) 3. Create a subscription API Key after subscribing For more details, see the [Subscription Plan Guide](https://docs.zenmux.ai/guide/subscription) Best for: Production, commercial products, enterprise applications Features: No rate limits, production-grade stability, pay-per-use billing API Key format: `sk-ai-v1-xxx` Getting started: 1. Visit the [pay-as-you-go page](https://zenmux.ai/platform/pay-as-you-go) 2. Top up your account (includes 20% bonus credit automatically) 3. Create an API Key in the \"Pay-as-you-go API Keys\" section For more details, see the [Pay-as-you-go Guide](https://docs.zenmux.ai/guide/pay-as-you-go) Important: Choose the Right API Key Type\nFor personal development or learning → Use a Subscription API Key (sk-ss-v1-xxx) for better value and lower cost For production or commercial projects → Use a Pay-as-you-go API Key (sk-ai-v1-xxx) for higher stability and no limits Note: Subscription keys are not allowed for production use. Using them incorrectly may result in account restrictions.\nStep 3: Configure Claude Code How the Configuration Works By default, Claude Code connects to Anthropic’s official service. To use Ring 1T via ZenMux, redirect requests using environment variables:\nNo changes needed to Claude Code itself — just set two environment variables Simple authentication — use your ZenMux API Key Transparent redirection — all requests route through ZenMux to Ring 1T The configuration uses two key variables:\nANTHROPIC_BASE_URL — points to ZenMux’s Anthropic-compatible endpoint ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN — your ZenMux API Key for authentication Important: Claude Code v2.0.7x Environment Variable Loading\nIn Claude Code v2.0.7x and later, environment variables in ~/.claude/settings.json cannot be reliably loaded during:\nFirst-time login Login after running logout Recommendation: Use shell profile environment variables (as shown below) to ensure consistent availability during both login and API requests through ZenMux.\nOption 1: Shell Profile Configuration (Recommended) # 1. Determine which shell you are using (usually bash or zsh): # - If using bash, edit ~/.bashrc # - If using zsh, edit ~/.zshrc # - If you're not sure, run echo $SHELL # 2. Append the following to the end of the corresponding config file (replace the API Key) # ============= ZenMux + Claude Code Configuration ============= # Connect Claude Code to ZenMux instead of Anthropic’s official service # Core settings: ZenMux endpoint and authentication export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=\"https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic\" # ZenMux Anthropic-compatible endpoint export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=\"sk-ss-v1-xxx\" # Replace with your ZenMux API Key (subscription sk-ss-v1-xxx or pay-as-you-go sk-ai-v1-xxx) export CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=\"1\" # Disable non-essential traffic export API_TIMEOUT_MS=\"30000000\" # API timeout in milliseconds # Avoid conflicts: if you previously set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY locally, explicitly clear it export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"\" # Model configuration: Set Ring 1T as your default model # Ring 1T excels at reasoning and complex coding tasks export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL=\"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Fast tier export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL=\"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Balanced tier (recommended) export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=\"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Most capable tier # 3. Apply the configuration (choose one): # Option 1: Reload the config file (recommended) source ~/.bashrc # if using bash # or source ~/.zshrc # if using zsh # Option 2: Restart the terminal window On Windows, the process is similar but uses PowerShell and the PowerShell Profile:\n# ============== Steps ============== # On Windows, use the PowerShell Profile to configure environment variables # PowerShell 7+ is recommended for a better experience # 1. Check whether the PowerShell Profile exists Test-Path $PROFILE # 2. If it returns False, create the Profile file if (!(Test-Path $PROFILE)) { New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force } # 3. Open the Profile file for editing notepad $PROFILE # If you use VSCode, you can also run: code $PROFILE # 4. Append the following to the end of the Profile file (replace the API Key) # ============= ZenMux + Claude Code Configuration ============= # Connect Claude Code to ZenMux instead of Anthropic’s official service # Core settings: ZenMux endpoint and authentication $env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL = \"https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic\" # ZenMux Anthropic-compatible endpoint $env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN = \"sk-ss-v1-xxx\" # Replace with your ZenMux API Key (subscription sk-ss-v1-xxx or pay-as-you-go sk-ai-v1-xxx) $env:CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC = \"1\" # Disable non-essential traffic $env:API_TIMEOUT_MS = \"30000000\" # API timeout in milliseconds # Avoid conflicts: if you previously set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY locally, explicitly clear it $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = \"\" # Model configuration: Set Ring 1T as your default model # Ring 1T excels at reasoning and complex coding tasks # https://zenmux.ai/inclusionAI/ring-1t $env:ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL = \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Fast tier $env:ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL = \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Balanced tier (recommended) $env:ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL = \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" # Most capable tier # 5. Save the file, then restart PowerShell to apply # Or run this in the current window: . $PROFILE # 6. Verify the environment variables were set successfully Write-Host \"ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL: $env:ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL\" Write-Host \"ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN: $env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN\" Important: Replace the API Key\nBe sure to replace sk-ss-v1-xxx or sk-ai-v1-xxx in the configuration with your real ZenMux API Key:\nSubscription API Key (recommended for personal development)\nFormat: sk-ss-v1-xxx Get it from: Subscription management page Detailed guide: Subscription plan docs Pay-as-you-go API Key (production)\nFormat: sk-ai-v1-xxx Get it from: Pay-as-you-go page Detailed guide: Pay-as-you-go docs Environment Variable Reference Variable Purpose Notes ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL Service endpoint Redirects Claude Code requests to ZenMux ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN Auth token Your ZenMux API Key (subscription or pay-as-you-go) Step 4: Launch Claude Code Open a new terminal window to load the environment variables, then start Claude Code:\nGo to your project directory:\ncd /path/to/your/project Start Claude Code:\nclaude On first launch, Claude Code will automatically:\nRead ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN from your environment variables Authenticate through the ZenMux Anthropic-compatible endpoint Begin working immediately\\u2014no additional login needed If you encounter issues:\nThe claude command not found \\u2192 Verify Claude Code is installed globally (see the installation steps above) Step 5: Verify the Connection After launching successfully, run /status in Claude Code to verify the connection. The output should display:\nAuth token: ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN Anthropic base URL: https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic What to check:\nAuth token displays ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (loaded from environment variables) Anthropic base URL displays https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic (the ZenMux endpoint) If the configuration is correct, your setup is complete—start leveraging Ring 1T’s reasoning capabilities in Claude Code.\nUsing Claude Code: CLI vs VSCode Extension You can use Claude Code in two ways. Choose based on your preferences:\nCLI (Command-Line) - Recommended When to use: You prefer command-line tools, want automatic environment variable loading, or need to work across multiple projects.\nThe CLI automatically loads environment variables from your shell profile (Steps 1-5 above):\ncd /path/to/your/project claude Advantages:\nEnvironment variables load automatically from shell profile No additional configuration needed in VSCode Works consistently across all projects in that shell Lightweight and straightforward VSCode Extension When to use: You prefer an integrated development environment, want settings isolated to VSCode, or use VSCode as your primary editor.\nConfigure Claude Code directly in VSCode settings:\nStep 1: Install the Extension Search for “Claude Code” in the VSCode Extensions marketplace and install it. Once installed, the Claude Code icon will appear in your sidebar.\nStep 2: Open Settings Click the extension’s Settings icon to open the configuration page:\nStep 3: Configure the Model and Environment Variables Click Edit in settings.json and add or modify the following configuration:\n{ \"claude-code.selectedModel\": \"inclusionai/ring-1t\", \"claudeCode.environmentVariables\": [ { \"name\": \"ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL\", \"value\": \"https://zenmux.ai/api/anthropic\" }, { \"name\": \"ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN\", \"value\": \"sk-ss-v1-xxx\" }, { \"name\": \"API_TIMEOUT_MS\", \"value\": \"3000000\" }, { \"name\": \"CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC\", \"value\": \"1\" }, { \"name\": \"ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL\", \"value\": \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" }, { \"name\": \"ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL\", \"value\": \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" }, { \"name\": \"ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL\", \"value\": \"inclusionai/ring-1t\" } ] } Important Configuration Notes:\nReplace the API Key: Replace sk-ss-v1-xxx with your real ZenMux API Key\nSubscription API Key (sk-ss-v1-xxx): best for personal development Pay-as-you-go API Key (sk-ai-v1-xxx): best for production Configuration priority:\nIf you previously configured shell environment variables in the CLI (~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc / PowerShell Profile), the VSCode extension will prefer the settings.json configuration To avoid conflicts, when using the VSCode extension, configure environment variables only in settings.json Model selection:\nclaude-code.selectedModel sets Ring 1T as the active model ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL configures Ring 1T across all speed tiers Use /model command during sessions to verify or switch models Step 4: Start Using It After configuration, you can start using the Claude Code extension:\nClick the Claude Code icon in the VSCode sidebar On first use, click Trust This Folder to grant access to your project files Start a conversation by entering your question or task Claude will automatically read and analyze your project files to help you Useful Commands\n/model — View the current model or switch to another /status — Check connection status and verify the configuration is correct /help — Display all available commands Note: If you encounter authentication issues in VSCode, ensure that ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL are only configured in settings.json to avoid conflicts with system environment variables.\nWhat It Looks Like Once set up, Ring 1T is ready to use in Claude Code:\nUse the /model command to confirm Ring 1T is active:\nNext Steps \u0026 Useful Commands Now that you have Ring 1T configured with Claude Code, here are some ways to get started:\nRecommended First Tasks:\nAsk Claude Code to explain or refactor existing code in your project Request help with complex algorithms or system design problems Use Ring 1T’s reasoning capabilities for debugging difficult issues Useful Commands in Claude Code:\n/model — View the current model or switch to another /status — Check connection status and verify the configuration /help — Display all available commands /pwd — Show current working directory /clear — Clear conversation history Explore More Models:\nBrowse all available models on ZenMux’s model list Switch models using /model command during your session Compare Ring 1T with other reasoning models for different use cases Learn More:\nRead Claude Code documentation for advanced features Check ZenMux documentation for platform details See the Ring 1T model page for model specifics Troubleshooting Common Issues API Key Error or Authentication Failure Issue: You see messages like “invalid API key,” “unauthorized,” or authentication failed.\nSolution:\nCheck the API Key format:\nSubscription API keys should start with sk-ss-v1- Pay-as-you-go API keys should start with sk-ai-v1- Ensure there are no extra spaces or newline characters Validate the API Key:\nSubscription: visit the subscription management page to check subscription status and quota Pay-as-you-go: visit the pay-as-you-go page to confirm sufficient balance Confirm environment variables are loaded:\n# macOS/Linux echo $ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN # Windows PowerShell echo $env:ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN If the output is empty, the environment variables were not loaded correctly. Re-run source ~/.zshrc or restart the terminal.\nCheck the API Key status:\nConfirm the API key is shown as “Enabled” in the console Check whether the API key has been deleted or disabled Get a new API Key:\nSubscription API Key guide Pay-as-you-go API Key guide Authentication Failure When Switching from Another Platform to ZenMux Issue: You previously used a Claude Code official account or another platform (e.g., MiniMax, GLM, etc.). After switching to ZenMux, authentication fails or configuration conflicts occur.\nSolution:\nThis usually happens because old config files cached prior authentication info, causing conflicts with the new ZenMux configuration.

To use Ring 1T, we redirect requests to ZenMux using environment variables. This approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Requires no changes to Claude Code</strong>: Just set environment variables</li><li><strong>Uses your ZenMux API Key</strong>: Simple authentication</li><li><strong>Enables Ring 1T access</strong>: Use the powerful reasoning model in Claude Code</li></ul><p>The setup involves two key environment variables: <code>ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL</code> (ZenMux endpoint) and <code>ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN</code> (your ZenMux API Key). This routes all Claude Code requests through ZenMux to Ring 1T.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Important Change in v2.0.7x</strong></p><p>Due to updates in Claude Code v2.0.7x, its <strong>environment-variable loading logic has changed</strong>: the <code>env</code> config in <code>~/.claude/settings.json</code> <strong>cannot be reliably read</strong> in the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>When <strong>logging in for the first time</strong> in Claude Code</li><li>When logging in again after running <strong>logout</strong></li></ul><p>Therefore, when connecting to ZenMux, it’s recommended to standardize on <strong>shell profile environment variables</strong> to ensure both login and requests go through ZenMux’s Anthropic-compatible endpoint.</p></blockquote><h3 id=step-2-get-a-zenmux-api-key>Step 2: Get a ZenMux API Key<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#step-2-get-a-zenmux-api-key>#</a></h3><p>Before configuring Claude Code, obtain a ZenMux API Key.
