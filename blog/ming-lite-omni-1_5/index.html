This new version delivers remarkable improvements across a wide range of tasks, including image and text understanding, document analysis, video comprehension, speech understanding and synthesis, as well as image generation and editing.\nBuilt on the Ling-lite-1.5 architecture, Ming-lite-omni V1.5 features a total of 20.3B parameters, with 3B active parameters in its Mixture of Experts (MoE) configuration. It has achieved impressive results across various multimodal benchmarks. Below, we highlight the key advancements in performance metrics and model architecture from this latest update.\nPerformance Comparison\nFramework\nIntroduction To achieve these advancements, we integrated our in-house innovations with cutting-edge developments from both academia and the open-source community. We explored several key areas, leading to significant breakthroughs and key findings detailed below.\nImage and Speech Generation Dual-Branch Decoupling for Image Generation: We implemented a dual-branch decoupling strategy that processes the reference image and the noise image with separate weights before they enter the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This approach effectively increases the model’s capacity for learning from the reference. To further refine the output, we added two extra transformer layers. ID \u0026 Scene Consistency Loss: To maintain character and scene identity during image editing, we introduced a new ID \u0026 Scene Consistency Loss. This function strategically increases focus on the edited region in the target image, boosts the influence of unedited areas from the reference image, and diminishes the influence of the edited areas from the reference. Perceptual Enhancement Strategy: We introduced a Perceptual Enhancement Strategy by improving the model’s ability to perceive structures through tasks like segmentation and keypoint detection. This provides greater structural control during generation and editing, leading to significant score improvements on metrics related to object position, structure, and count (see Table A for details). Multi-task Collaborative Learning: A Multi-task Collaborative Learning approach allows generation and editing tasks to synergistically improve one another. By treating segmentation as a colorization-based editing task within a unified training pipeline, we achieved significant gains in segmentation accuracy and enhanced the precision of local edits, resulting in smoother and more natural transitions at the edges of edited areas. New Audio Decoder: On the speech generation front, we developed a novel audio decoder that is fully context-aware, directly processing output features from the LLM. Efficient Speech Generation: To improve prosody and real-time generation capabilities, we applied BPE encoding to the discrete audio codec tokens, which successfully reduced the audio frame rate by 35%. Comprehensive Data Upgrades: Sourced high-quality portrait data, filtered by resolution, facial detail, and face size. Collected and curated a high-quality celebrity dataset with processed face crops. Expanded the model’s capabilities by building new training subsets for edge maps, segmentation maps, text-in-image, and facial expressions. Image, Text, Video, and Speech Understanding MRoPE for Spatiotemporal Awareness: We integrated MRoPE (Multi-dimensional RoPE), which applies positional encoding across three dimensions (time, height, and width). This equips the model with a native understanding of space and time, enabling highly efficient cross-modal modeling and significantly boosting comprehension accuracy for videos and complex images. Efficient Full-Parameter Training: By optimizing learning rates and the multimodal data mixture, we upgraded our pre-training from a phased approach of freezing/unfreezing LLM layers to a streamlined, efficient full-parameter training regimen. This shortened the training cycle by 26.5% with no loss in performance. Video Understanding via Curriculum Learning: We adopted a curriculum learning strategy for video understanding, progressively increasing the complexity from short-form to long-form videos to enhance the model’s capabilities. Complex Document Understanding with CoT: For complex document analysis, we incorporated a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to build structured reasoning paths, effectively improving the model’s problem-solving abilities on intricate queries. Comprehensive Data Upgrades: Pre-training: Added structured text entity data to fill knowledge graph gaps. Expanded with high-quality product data to enhance general knowledge. Instruction Fine-Tuning: Improved data precision for fine-grained visual perception (e.g., object counting, color, and scene recognition). Increased data depth for specialized domain recognition (e.g., flora/fauna, vehicles, and ingredients). Enhanced cross-disciplinary reasoning in complex visual-text tasks through targeted data optimization. For speech understanding, we infused instruction text with metadata like domain, topic, and language (including dialects). This boosted model performance and enabled comprehensive support for Mandarin, English, Cantonese, Sichuanese, Shanghainese, and Minnan. Aligning with User Preferences To ensure that improvements on standard benchmarks translate directly to a superior real-world user experience, we created our own human evaluation benchmark and conducted internal, head-to-head evaluations against other models. Thanks to our high-quality preference alignment data, Ming-lite-omni V1.5 demonstrates a distinct advantage over leading models in the accuracy (low hallucination rate), relevance, formatting, and fluency of its visual question-answering responses. On our internal adversarial test set, Ming-lite-omni V1.5 achieved an 87.07% win rate against Ming-lite-omni V1, marking a significant enhancement in user experience.\nBenchmark Dimension Qwen2.5-VL-7B Ming-Omni-Lite V1.5 Relevance 4.308 4.5 Fluency 4.765 4.91 Richness 3.828 3.69 Formatting 4.727 4.8 Accuracy 3.741 3.92 Average 4.274 4.365 Demos Image Editing To address the challenge of maintaining character and scene identity during image editing, we’ve introduced the ID \u0026 Scene Consistency Loss. This function strategically increases the weight of the edited region in the target image, boosts the influence of unedited areas from the reference image, and reduces the influence of the edited areas within that same reference.\nGenerative Image Segmentation Next User Given the following instructions: little girl, pink, your monitors colors off friend p pink shirt girl; please perform referring segmentation on this image.

Ming-Lite-Omni V1.5 Image Generation We introduced a Perceptual Enhancement Strategy by optimizing the model’s structural awareness through tasks like segmentation and keypoint detection. This improves its understanding of image details and spatial relationships, giving us greater structural control over the generation and editing process. The result is a significant boost in scores on the GenEval benchmark, particularly for metrics related to position, structure, and count: 1-Obj 2-Obj Counting Colors Position Color Attr Avg.

To further refine the output, we added two extra transformer layers.</li><li><strong>ID & Scene Consistency Loss:</strong> To maintain character and scene identity during image editing, we introduced a new <strong>ID & Scene Consistency Loss</strong>. This function strategically increases focus on the edited region in the target image, boosts the influence of unedited areas from the reference image, and diminishes the influence of the edited areas from the reference.</li><li><strong>Perceptual Enhancement Strategy:</strong> We introduced a <strong>Perceptual Enhancement Strategy</strong> by improving the model&rsquo;s ability to perceive structures through tasks like segmentation and keypoint detection. This provides greater structural control during generation and editing, leading to significant score improvements on metrics related to object position, structure, and count (see <a href=#table1>Table A</a> for details).</li><li><strong>Multi-task Collaborative Learning:</strong> A <strong>Multi-task Collaborative Learning</strong> approach allows generation and editing tasks to synergistically improve one another. By treating segmentation as a colorization-based editing task within a unified training pipeline, we achieved significant gains in segmentation accuracy and enhanced the precision of local edits, resulting in smoother and more natural transitions at the edges of edited areas.</li><li><strong>New Audio Decoder:</strong> On the speech generation front, we developed a novel audio decoder that is fully context-aware, directly processing output features from the LLM.</li><li><strong>Efficient Speech Generation:</strong> To improve prosody and real-time generation capabilities, we applied BPE encoding to the discrete audio codec tokens, which successfully reduced the audio frame rate by 35%.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Data Upgrades:</strong><ul><li>Sourced high-quality portrait data, filtered by resolution, facial detail, and face size.</li><li>Collected and curated a high-quality celebrity dataset with processed face crops.</li><li>Expanded the model&rsquo;s capabilities by building new training subsets for edge maps, segmentation maps, text-in-image, and facial expressions.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=image-text-video-and-speech-understanding>Image, Text, Video, and Speech Understanding<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#image-text-video-and-speech-understanding>#</a></h3><ol><li><strong>MRoPE for Spatiotemporal Awareness:</strong> We integrated MRoPE (Multi-dimensional RoPE), which applies positional encoding across three dimensions (time, height, and width). This equips the model with a native understanding of space and time, enabling highly efficient cross-modal modeling and significantly boosting comprehension accuracy for videos and complex images.</li><li><strong>Efficient Full-Parameter Training:</strong> By optimizing learning rates and the multimodal data mixture, we upgraded our pre-training from a phased approach of <strong>freezing/unfreezing LLM layers</strong> to a streamlined, <strong>efficient full-parameter training</strong> regimen. This shortened the training cycle by 26.5% with no loss in performance.</li><li><strong>Video Understanding via Curriculum Learning:</strong> We adopted a curriculum learning strategy for video understanding, progressively increasing the complexity from short-form to long-form videos to enhance the model&rsquo;s capabilities.</li><li><strong>Complex Document Understanding with CoT:</strong> For complex document analysis, we incorporated a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy to build structured reasoning paths, effectively improving the model&rsquo;s problem-solving abilities on intricate queries.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Data Upgrades:</strong><ul><li><strong>Pre-training:</strong><ul><li>Added structured text entity data to fill knowledge graph gaps.</li><li>Expanded with high-quality product data to enhance general knowledge.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Instruction Fine-Tuning:</strong><ul><li>Improved data precision for fine-grained visual perception (e.g., object counting, color, and scene recognition).</li><li>Increased data depth for specialized domain recognition (e.g., flora/fauna, vehicles, and ingredients).</li><li>Enhanced cross-disciplinary reasoning in complex visual-text tasks through targeted data optimization.</li><li>For speech understanding, we infused instruction text with metadata like domain, topic, and language (including dialects). This boosted model performance and enabled comprehensive support for Mandarin, English, Cantonese, Sichuanese, Shanghainese, and Minnan.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=aligning-with-user-preferences>Aligning with User Preferences<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#aligning-with-user-preferences>#</a></h3><p>To ensure that improvements on standard benchmarks translate directly to a superior real-world user experience, we created our own <strong>human evaluation benchmark</strong> and conducted internal, head-to-head evaluations against other models.
