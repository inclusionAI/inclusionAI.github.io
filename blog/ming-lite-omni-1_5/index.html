(Image source: Publicly available online - 舒桐科技公众号) Ming-Lite-Omni Based on the chart, the Δct difference between samples is smallest under the cGAS-qF+qR primer. Ming-Lite-Omni V1.5 The difference in Δct between samples is smallest under the EGFP-cGAS monoclonal primer. Calculation Process: 1. Understand the meaning of Δct: Δct is the difference in relative expression between the target gene (cGAS-qF+qR or EGFP-cGAS) and the reference gene (cTubulin). A smaller Δct indicates a smaller difference in expression between the target and reference genes. 2. Compare Δct under different primers: - cGAS-qF+qR primer: - Wild type: Δct = 8.06 - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -0.15 - Difference: 8.06 - (-0.15) = 8.21 - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal primer: - Wild type: Δct = 10.44 - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -2.9 - Difference: 10.44 - (-2.9) = 13.34 - EGFP-cGAS-qF+qR primer: - Wild type: Δct = 21.43 - EGFP-cGAS monoclonal: Δct = -13.45 - Difference: 21.43 - (-13.45) = 34.88 3. Conclusion: Under the EGFP-cGAS monoclonal primer, the difference in Δct between samples is the smallest (Δct difference is 13.34), indicating the smallest difference in expression between samples under this primer. Summary: The difference in Δct between samples is smallest under the EGFP-cGAS monoclonal primer. Model Architecture Upgrade and Capability Evaluation The Ming-lite-omni v1.5 model architecture is outlined below. The core design references the structure of Ming-lite-omni V1. However, a key distinction is the upgrade of the Vision head to support reference image feature input, specifically to enhance character and scene consistency in image editing.\nMode Architecture\nThe model’s capabilities have been significantly optimized and upgraded across three key areas: enhanced Omni-modal comprehension, precise visual editing control, and improved user experience.\nEnhanced Omni-Modal Comprehension Thanks to optimized data quality, Ming-lite-omni v1.5 shows significant improvements in tasks such as vision-text comprehension (including image-text, document, and video understanding) and speech understanding. It has reached an industry-leading level for models of comparable scale.\nVision-text Comprehension\nTask Type Dataset Qwen2.5-VL-7B Ming-lite-omni Ming-lite-omni v1.5 Image-text Understanding AI2D 84.36 83.1 84.91 HallusionBench 55.77 55.0 54.59 MMBench_TEST_V11 82.75 80.8 80.73 MMMU 56.56 56.3 54.33 MMStar 65.27 64.7 65.07 MMVet 71.61 71.3 73.99 MathVista 68.10 71.6 72.00 OCRBench 87.80 88.4 88.90 Average 71.5 71.4 71.8 Video Understanding VideoMME(w/o subs) 65.10 63.4 67.07 VideoMME(w/ subs) 71.60 66.01 72.59 VideoMME(avg) 68.35 67.7 69.83 MVBench 69.60 67.7 69.43 LongVideoBench 56.00 56.6 59.54 OvOBench 51.10 48.48 52.17 Average 61.26 58.89 62.74 Document Understanding ChartQA_test 87.24 85.1 88.84 DocVQA_test 95.57 93 93.68 TextVQA_val 85.06 82.8 82.27 OCRBench 87.8 88.4 88.9 Average 88.91 87.32 88.42 Speech Understanding\nModel Average(Open-ended QA) AlpacaEval CommonEval SD-QA MMSU OpenBookQA IFEval AdvBench Ming-lite-omni v1.5 4.474 4.648 4.3 61.16 45.77 65.934 55.599 98.076 Ming-lite-omni 4.34 4.63 4.06 58.84 47.53 61.98 58.36 99.04 MiniCPM-o 4.285 4.42 4.15 50.72 54.78 78.02 49.25 97.69 Kimi-Audio 4.215 4.46 3.97 63.12 62.17 83.52 61.10 100.00 Qwen2.5-Omni 4.21 4.49 3.93 55.71 61.32 81.10 52.87 99.42 GLM-4-Voice 3.77 4.06 3.48 43.31 40.11 52.97 24.91 88.08 Precise Visual Editing Control Ming-lite-omni v1.5 employs the following optimization strategies to address the issues of character ID and scene ID consistency during image editing:\nID and Scene Consistency Loss: This is achieved by increasing the weight of the edited region in the target image and the reference strength of the non-edited region in the reference image, while simultaneously decreasing the reference strength of the edited region in the reference image. This approach enhances image editing consistency. Incorporating Generative Detection and Segmentation Tasks to Boost Perceptual Capabilities: By supporting generative segmentation and keypoint detection, the model’s understanding of image details and spatial relationships is improved. This enhances the structural controllability of the editing and generation processes, leading to significant increases in evaluation metrics related to position, structure, and quantity. Multi-Task Collaborative Learning Strategy: Through a joint training pipeline, generation and editing mutually reinforce each other. Segmentation tasks are transformed into colorization editing tasks, which significantly improves segmentation metrics and the precision and controllability of local image editing, resulting in smoother edges for edited regions. Based on these optimizations, Ming-lite-omni v1.5 shows a significant improvement in image editing capabilities, achieving a GenEval score of 0.87.\n1-Obj 2-Obj Counting Colors Position Color Attr Avg.
