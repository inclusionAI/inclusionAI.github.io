🚀 Technical Highlights

First unified continuous speech tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks: MingTok-Audio is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio based on a VAE framework with a causal Transformer architecture, the first continuous speech tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, and enables a closed-loop system with LLMs through hierarchical feature representations, makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks.
First Speech LLM with unifed continuous tokenizer for both understanding and generation: Ming-UniAudio is an end-to-end unified speech language model with a single LLM backbone for both understanding and generation tasks, enhanced with a Diffusion Head to ensure high-fidelity speech synthesis.
First universal free-form speech editing model for semantic and acoustic tasks without temporal regime: We introduce the first instruction-guided, free-form speech editing framework that supports comprehensive semantic and acoustic edits without requiring explicit edit regions, along with Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first open-source evaluation set for such tasks.
First benchmark for free-form speech editing: We propose Audio-Edit-Benchmark, the first open-source free-form evaluation set comprising editing tasks of four semantic and five acoustic types, to evaluate the model&rsquo;s editing performance.

          Hey Chris, you won&rsquo;t believe what happened when I tried sending rent through Zelle yesterday. I hit some daily ACH transfer limit! My landlord&rsquo;s insisting on cashier&rsquo;s checks now. Remember how Sarah&rsquo;s Venmo payment got flagged last month? The bank&rsquo;s fraud detection system kept asking about transaction memos and &lsquo;source of funds&rsquo; verification. Honestly, these FDIC regulations around peer-to-peer payments are getting ridiculous. I had to provide three months of bank statements just to increase my wire transfer threshold. Oh, and don&rsquo;t even get me started on cryptocurrency wallet KYC requirements.

          So listen, I finally canceled my Chase Sapphire Reserve last week. Remember how they touted those Priority Pass lounges and Luxury Hotel Collection benefits? Turns out I only used the T S A Pre Check credit once this whole year! The annual fee jumped to five hundred fifty dollars, plus they started requiring eighteen thousand points to waive it. My Amex Platinum isn&rsquo;t any better that seven hundred dollar fee just hit, and their new rewards structure requires thirty thousand in annual spending for bonus miles. Oh, and get this Citibank&rsquo;s Prestige Card now charges two hundred bucks for authorized users! Honestly, these Visa Infinite perks like concierge services and purchase protection sound fancy, but when do regular people actually use E M V chip security protocols or dynamic currency conversion?

🚀 Technical Highlights

First unified continuous speech tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks: MingTok-Audio is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio based on a VAE framework with a causal Transformer architecture, the first continuous speech tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, and enables a closed-loop system with LLMs through hierarchical feature representations, makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks.
First Speech LLM with unifed continuous tokenizer for both understanding and generation: Ming-UniAudio is an end-to-end unified speech language model with a single LLM backbone for both understanding and generation tasks, enhanced with a Diffusion Head to ensure high-fidelity speech synthesis.
First universal free-form speech editing model for semantic and acoustic tasks without temporal regime: We introduce the first instruction-guided, free-form speech editing framework that supports comprehensive semantic and acoustic edits without requiring explicit edit regions, along with Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first open-source evaluation set for such tasks.
First benchmark for free-form speech editing: We propose Audio-Edit-Benchmark, the first open-source free-form evaluation set comprising editing tasks of four semantic and five acoustic types, to evaluate the model&rsquo;s editing performance.

          Hey Chris, you won&rsquo;t believe what happened when I tried sending rent through Zelle yesterday. I hit some daily ACH transfer limit! My landlord&rsquo;s insisting on cashier&rsquo;s checks now. Remember how Sarah&rsquo;s Venmo payment got flagged last month? The bank&rsquo;s fraud detection system kept asking about transaction memos and &lsquo;source of funds&rsquo; verification. Honestly, these FDIC regulations around peer-to-peer payments are getting ridiculous. I had to provide three months of bank statements just to increase my wire transfer threshold. Oh, and don&rsquo;t even get me started on cryptocurrency wallet KYC requirements.

          So listen, I finally canceled my Chase Sapphire Reserve last week. Remember how they touted those Priority Pass lounges and Luxury Hotel Collection benefits? Turns out I only used the T S A Pre Check credit once this whole year! The annual fee jumped to five hundred fifty dollars, plus they started requiring eighteen thousand points to waive it. My Amex Platinum isn&rsquo;t any better that seven hundred dollar fee just hit, and their new rewards structure requires thirty thousand in annual spending for bonus miles. Oh, and get this Citibank&rsquo;s Prestige Card now charges two hundred bucks for authorized users! Honestly, these Visa Infinite perks like concierge services and purchase protection sound fancy, but when do regular people actually use E M V chip security protocols or dynamic currency conversion?

🚀 Technical Highlights

First unified continuous speech tokenizer for both understanding and generation tasks: MingTok-Audio is a unified continuous speech tokenizer MingTok-Audio based on a VAE framework with a causal Transformer architecture, the first continuous speech tokenizer to effectively integrate semantic and acoustic features, and enables a closed-loop system with LLMs through hierarchical feature representations, makes it suitable for both understanding and generation tasks.
First Speech LLM with unifed continuous tokenizer for both understanding and generation: Ming-UniAudio is an end-to-end unified speech language model with a single LLM backbone for both understanding and generation tasks, enhanced with a Diffusion Head to ensure high-fidelity speech synthesis.
First universal free-form speech editing model for semantic and acoustic tasks without temporal regime: We introduce the first instruction-guided, free-form speech editing framework that supports comprehensive semantic and acoustic edits without requiring explicit edit regions, along with Ming-Freeform-Audio-Edit, the first open-source evaluation set for such tasks.
First benchmark for free-form speech editing: We propose Audio-Edit-Benchmark, the first open-source free-form evaluation set comprising editing tasks of four semantic and five acoustic types, to evaluate the model&rsquo;s editing performance.

          Hey Chris, you won&rsquo;t believe what happened when I tried sending rent through Zelle yesterday. I hit some daily ACH transfer limit! My landlord&rsquo;s insisting on cashier&rsquo;s checks now. Remember how Sarah&rsquo;s Venmo payment got flagged last month? The bank&rsquo;s fraud detection system kept asking about transaction memos and &lsquo;source of funds&rsquo; verification. Honestly, these FDIC regulations around peer-to-peer payments are getting ridiculous. I had to provide three months of bank statements just to increase my wire transfer threshold. Oh, and don&rsquo;t even get me started on cryptocurrency wallet KYC requirements.

          So listen, I finally canceled my Chase Sapphire Reserve last week. Remember how they touted those Priority Pass lounges and Luxury Hotel Collection benefits? Turns out I only used the T S A Pre Check credit once this whole year! The annual fee jumped to five hundred fifty dollars, plus they started requiring eighteen thousand points to waive it. My Amex Platinum isn&rsquo;t any better that seven hundred dollar fee just hit, and their new rewards structure requires thirty thousand in annual spending for bonus miles. Oh, and get this Citibank&rsquo;s Prestige Card now charges two hundred bucks for authorized users! Honestly, these Visa Infinite perks like concierge services and purchase protection sound fancy, but when do regular people actually use E M V chip security protocols or dynamic currency conversion?

My Amex Platinum isn&rsquo;t any better that seven hundred dollar fee just hit, and their new rewards structure requires thirty thousand in annual spending for bonus miles.
