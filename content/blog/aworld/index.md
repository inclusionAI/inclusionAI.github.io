## Introduction
AWorld (Agent World) is a multi-agent playground that enables agents to collaborate and self-improve. The framework supports a wide range of applications, including but not limited to product prototype verification, foundation model training and Multi-Agent System (MAS) design meta-learning.

### Runtime Key Features
| 1. Agent Construction | 2. Topology Orchestration | 3. Environments |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Support for various model services <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Integration with MCP tools <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Custom tool support | ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Protocol encapsulation between models and tools <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Protocol encapsulation among agents | ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Runtime state management <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ State tracing support <br> ‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Distributed, high-concurrency environments for training |

### Self-Improvement with Diverse Runtimes
By constructing diverse runtime environments (with tools, agents, or models in them), AWorld aims to find the limitations of a model and push intelligence forward. Here we will record some of our work to prove the effectiveness of our proposal.

### Demo of GAIA Agent-Runtime
![GAIA Agent Runtime Demo](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld/raw/main/readme_assets/gaia_demo.gif)

Here we first introduce the **GAIA runtime**, which can be constructed on your local computer. It can be used for:

- **Product prototype verification**
- **Self-improvement training** (See [training pipeline](#backward) for details)

Follow the instructions in [`./examples/gaia/README.md`](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld/blob/main/examples/gaia/README.md) to initialize the GAIA agent runtime and run the demo shown above.

## Installation
 Python>=3.11:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld
cd AWorld
python setup.py install
```

## Quick Start
> Here's a quick start guide to: (1) create your first agent; (2) equip it with a MCP tool; (3) assign a teammate; and (4) answer a user query through teamwork.

```python
from aworld.config.conf import AgentConfig
from aworld.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from aworld.runner import Runners
from aworld.core.agent.swarm import Swarm

if __name__ == '__main__':
    agent_config = AgentConfig(
        llm_provider="openai",
        llm_model_name="gpt-4o",

        # Set via environment variable or direct configuration
        # llm_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", 
        # llm_base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    )

    # Register the MCP tool here, or create a separate configuration file.
    mcp_config = {
        "mcpServers": {
            "amap-amap-sse": {
                "type": "sse",
                "url": "https://mcp.amap.com/sse?key=YOUR_API_KEY",
                "timeout": 5,
                "sse_read_timeout": 300
            }
        }
    }

    # Create your first agent equipped with an MCP tool
    search = Agent(
        conf=agent_config,
        name="search_agent",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful agent.",
        mcp_servers=["amap-amap-sse"], # MCP server name for agent to use
        mcp_config=mcp_config
    )

    # Add a new teammate to the agent
    summary = Agent(
        conf=agent_config,
        name="summary_agent",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful summary agent."
    )

    # Collaborate as a team; the default is a static workflow
    swarm = Swarm(search, summary)

    # Run agent team
    res = Runners.sync_run(input="Hotels within 1 kilometer of West Lake in Hangzhou",
                     swarm=swarm)
    print(res)
```

## Architecture
AWorld is designed to achieve two primary objectives: (1) provide an efficient forward process, and (2) facilitate diverse backward processes, including but not limited to foundation model training and system design meta-learning.

### Forward

### Backward
> During training, an action-state rollout demonstration using AWorld's distributed environments.

<!-- > An illustration of training code that seamlessly integrates the learning framework (Swift, in this example) with AWorld as the environment.

```python
# git clone **
# git apply diff_patch
# run the code

``` -->

## Demo
> Running Pre-defined Agents (e.g., see [demo code](https://github.com/inclusionAI/AWorld/blob/main/examples/browsers/run.py)). Below are demonstration videos showcasing AWorld's capabilities across various agent configurations and environments.
