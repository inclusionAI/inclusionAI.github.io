## Introduce Ming-lite-omni v1.5

### Controllable Image Generation: Pixel-Level Control, Infinite Creativity

Ming-lite-omni v1.5 significantly optimizes Scene Consistency and ID Consistency (Character / Style Consistency) in image editing. When editing human figures, it demonstrates a clear advantage in maintaining scene and character ID. Furthermore, it expands support for perceptual tasks such as generative segmentation, depth prediction, object detection, and edge contour generation.

## Model Architecture Upgrade and Capability Evaluation
The Ming-lite-omni v1.5 model architecture is outlined below. The core design references the structure of Ming-lite-omni V1. However, a key distinction is the upgrade of the Vision head to support reference image feature input, specifically to enhance character and scene consistency in image editing.

The model's capabilities have been significantly optimized and upgraded across three key areas: enhanced Omni-modal comprehension, precise visual editing control, and improved user experience.

### Enhanced Omni-Modal Comprehension

Thanks to optimized data quality, Ming-lite-omni v1.5 shows significant improvements in tasks such as vision-text comprehension (including image-text, document, and video understanding) and speech understanding. It has reached an industry-leading level for models of comparable scale.

### Precise Visual Editing Control
Ming-lite-omni v1.5 employs the following optimization strategies to address the issues of character ID and scene ID consistency during image editing:

1. ID and Scene Consistency Loss: This is achieved by increasing the weight of the edited region in the target image and the reference strength of the non-edited region in the reference image, while simultaneously decreasing the reference strength of the edited region in the reference image. This approach enhances image editing consistency.
2. Incorporating Generative Detection and Segmentation Tasks to Boost Perceptual Capabilities: By supporting generative segmentation and keypoint detection, the model's understanding of image details and spatial relationships is improved. This enhances the structural controllability of the editing and generation processes, leading to significant increases in evaluation metrics related to position, structure, and quantity.
3. Multi-Task Collaborative Learning Strategy: Through a joint training pipeline, generation and editing mutually reinforce each other. Segmentation tasks are transformed into colorization editing tasks, which significantly improves segmentation metrics and the precision and controllability of local image editing, resulting in smoother edges for edited regions.

Based on these optimizations, Ming-lite-omni v1.5 shows a significant improvement in image editing capabilities, achieving a GenEval score of 0.87.

|Ming-lite-omni v1.5| 0.99   | 0.93   | 0.86      | 0.87 |0.90 |0.66 |0.87 |  

### Optimized User Experience
Thanks to the construction of high-quality alignment preference data, Ming-lite-omni v1.5 demonstrates a certain advantage over leading models in terms of correctness, relevance, format aesthetics, and fluency of expression for image-text Q&A. Ming-lite-omni v1.5 achieved a win rate of 87.07% against Ming-lite-omni V1 on internal adversarial evaluation sets, indicating a significant optimization in user experience.
