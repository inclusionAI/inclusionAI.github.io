<i style="color: grey;">Note: This is the pronunciation of QwQ: /kwju:/ , similar to the word "quill".</i>

What does it mean to think, to question, to understand? These are the deep waters that QwQ (Qwen with Questions) wades into. Like an eternal student of wisdom, it approaches every problem - be it mathematics, code, or knowledge of our world - with genuine wonder and doubt. QwQ embodies that ancient philosophical spirit: it knows that it knows nothing, and that's precisely what drives its curiosity. Before settling on any answer, it turns inward, questioning its own assumptions, exploring different paths of thought, always seeking deeper truth. Yet, like all seekers of wisdom, QwQ has its limitations. This version is but an early step on a longer journey - a student still learning to walk the path of reasoning. Its thoughts sometimes wander, its answers aren't always complete, and its wisdom is still growing. But isn't that the beauty of true learning? To be both capable and humble, knowledgeable yet always questioning? We invite you to explore alongside QwQ, embracing both its insights and its imperfections as part of the endless quest for understanding.

# If Video Presentation is Required

The evolution of multimodal large models is continually pushing the boundaries of what we believe technology can achieve. From the initial QwenVL to the latest Qwen2.5 VL, we have made progress in enhancing the model's ability to understand image content. Today, we are excited to introduce a new model, Qwen VLo, a unified multimodal understanding and generation model. This newly upgraded model not only "understands" the world but also generates high-quality recreations based on that understanding, truly bridging the gap between perception and creation. Note that this is a preview version and you can access it through Qwen Chat. You can directly send a prompt like "Generate a picture of a cute cat" to generate an image or upload an image of a cat and ask "Add a cap on the cat's head" to modify an image. The image generation process is shown below.

Using Qwen-TTS with Qwen API is simple. We demonstrate a code snippet for you to play with it below:

```python
import os
import requests
import dashscope


def get_api_key():
    api_key = os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY")
    if not api_key:
        raise EnvironmentError("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
    return api_key


def synthesize_speech(text, voice="Dylan", model="qwen-tts-latest"):
    api_key = get_api_key()
    try:
        response = dashscope.audio.qwen_tts.SpeechSynthesizer.call(
            model=model,
            api_key=api_key,
            text=text,
            voice=voice,
        )
        
        # Check if response is None
        if response is None:
            raise RuntimeError("API call returned None response")
        
        # Check if response.output is None
        if response.output is None:
            raise RuntimeError("API call failed: response.output is None")
        
        # Check if response.output.audio exists
        if not hasattr(response.output, 'audio') or response.output.audio is None:
            raise RuntimeError("API call failed: response.output.audio is None or missing")
        
        audio_url = response.output.audio["url"]
        return audio_url
    except Exception as e:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Speech synthesis failed: {e}")


def download_audio(audio_url, save_path):
    try:
        resp = requests.get(audio_url, timeout=10)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        with open(save_path, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(resp.content)
        print(f"Audio file saved to: {save_path}")
    except Exception as e:

# Limitations


**QwQ-32B-Preview** is an experimental research model developed by the Qwen Team, focused on advancing AI reasoning capabilities. As a preview release, it demonstrates promising analytical abilities while having several important limitations:

1. **Language Mixing and Code-Switching**: The model may mix languages or switch between them unexpectedly, affecting response clarity.
2. **Recursive Reasoning Loops**: The model may enter circular reasoning patterns, leading to lengthy responses without a conclusive answer.
3. **Safety and Ethical Considerations**: The model requires enhanced safety measures to ensure reliable and secure performance, and users should exercise caution when deploying it.
4. **Performance and Benchmark Limitations**: The model excels in math and coding but has room for improvement in other areas, such as common sense reasoning and nuanced language understanding.


# Demo Cases

In the following examples, we invite you to witness the profound depths of QwQ-32B-Preview's contemplative abilities. Like a seeker of wisdom on an endless journey of discovery, the model demonstrates its capacity for deep introspection - questioning its own assumptions, engaging in thoughtful self-dialogue, and carefully examining each step of its reasoning process. Through these cases, you'll observe how QwQ embodies the timeless understanding that true knowledge emerges not from hasty conclusions, but from patient inquiry and the courage to challenge one's own certainties in the eternal pursuit of truth.

# Reflections on the Journey Ahead

The path to understanding reasoning in large language models branches into many directions, each offering unique insights into the nature of machine intelligence. Our research spans multiple domains - from process reward models that shape learning patterns, to LLM critique that fosters deeper analysis, to multi-step reasoning that builds complex thought, to reinforcement learning with system feedback that enables growth through real-world interactions. While the destination remains unclear, each step brings us closer to understanding how machines think and reason. We don't know precisely where this journey leads, but we continue forward with unwavering determination - toward truth, toward intelligence, toward the realm where amazing happens.
