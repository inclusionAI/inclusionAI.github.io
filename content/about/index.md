Welcome to the official Github organization homepage for inclusionAI.

This organization contains the series of open-source projects from Ant Group with dedicated efforts to work towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

In here you can find Large Language Models (LLM), Reinforcement Learning (RL) or other systems related to model training and inference, and other AGI-related frameworks or applications.
